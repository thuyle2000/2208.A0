        Lyrics
        I'm sitting here in a boring room
        It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
        I'm wasting my time I got nothing to do
        I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you
        But nothing ever happens
        And I wonder
        I'm driving around in my car
        I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
        I'd like to change my point of view
        I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
        But nothing ever happens
        And I wonder
        I wonder how, I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the
        Blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see
        Is just a yellow lemon tree
        I'm turning my head up and down
        I'm turning, turning, turning, turning
        Turning around
        And all that I can see
        Is just another lemon tree
        Sing dah
        Dah-dah-dah-dam, dee-dab-dah
        Dah-dah-dah-dam, dee-dab-dah
        Dab-deedly dah
        I'm sitting here, I miss the power
        I'd like to go out, taking a shower
        But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
        I feel so tired, put myself into bed
        Well, nothing ever happens
        And I wonder
        Isolation is not good for me
        Isolation, I don't want to
        Sit on a lemon tree
        I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy
        Maybe anyhow I'll get another toy
        And everything will happen
        And you wonder
        I wonder how, I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the
        Blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see
        Is just another yellow lemon tree
        I'm turning my head up and down
        I'm turning, turning, turning, turning
        Turning around
        And all that I can see
        Is just a yellow lemon tree
        And I wonder, wonder
        I wonder how, I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the
        Blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see
        And all that I can see
        And all that I can see
        Is just a yellow lemon tree
