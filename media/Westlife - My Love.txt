Westlife - My Love 


Lyrics
An empty street, an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.

I wonder how, I wonder why,
I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together, oh, yeah.

And all my love, I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love.
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love.

I try to read, I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking, oh, no.

I wonder how, I wonder why,
I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together, oh, yeah.

And all my love, I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love.
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again,

To hold you in my arms,
To promise you my love,
To tell you from the heart,
You're all I'm thinking of.

Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love.
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love.

Say a little prayer (my sweet love)
Dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue (woah, yeah) to see you once again, my love. (oh, my love)
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love.
